# Introduction

THz TDS, Images

# Statement of need

Interactive analysis, performance, open-source, cross-platform

# Structure

diagram of thread structure 

# Installation

Bundles for all platforms, dependencies, compilation instructions

# Usage

GUI layout, select pixels, different views

## IO

File loading, meta-data, cite dotTHz

## Filters

### FFT Window
discuss different windows

### Frequency Band Pass Filter
filter in frequency domain

### Time Domain Slice
slice through time axis - depth information of image

### Deconvolution

cite Arnaud's paper

### Extend filters

document changes required to implement custom filters



Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:

- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }


# Outlook

talk about possible community contribution
