    abstract={Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is in many ways a well-established, proven, and versatile spectroscopic technique that is frequently and routinely used in many laboratories. The basis of high-quality optical data on materials using THz-TDS is the correct extraction of the complex-valued dielectric properties (index of refraction, permittivity, or conductivity) from the recorded amplitude and phase of the involved THz signals. The focus of this paper is to discuss stable methods for finding the physically meaningful frequency-dependent optical phase from time-domain signals, thereby avoiding some of the unphysical solutions to the inversion problem that is the central part of THz-TDS analysis. The paper discusses problems associated with the positioning of the THz signal in the recorded time window, phase offsets due to noise in the experimental data, and phase correction in the case of strongly dispersive media such as transparent semiconductors in the frequency range below but close to the transverse optical phonons.},

	abstract = {From investigating molecular vibrations to observing galaxies, terahertz technology has found extensive applications in research and development over the past three decades. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and imaging have experienced signiﬁcant growth and now dominate spectral observations ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz. However, the lack of standardised protocols for data processing, dissemination, and archiving poses challenges in collaborating and sharing terahertz data between research groups. To tackle these challenges, we present the dotTHz project, which introduces a standardised terahertz data format and the associated open-source tools for processing of dotTHz ﬁles. The dotTHz project aims to facilitate seamless data processing and analysis by providing a common framework. All software components are released under the MIT licence through GitHub repositories to encourage widespread adoption, modiﬁcation, and collaboration. We invite the terahertz community to actively contribute to the dotTHz project, fostering the development of additional tools that encompass a greater breadth and depth of functionality. By working together, we can establish a comprehensive suite of resources that beneﬁt the entire terahertz community.},

The OpenGLProgramming Guide, Seventh Edition, provides definitive and comprehensive information on OpenGL and the OpenGL Utility Library. The previous edition covered OpenGL through Version 2.1. This seventh edition of the best-selling red book describes the latest features of OpenGL Versions 3.0 and 3.1. You will find clear explanations of OpenGL functionality and many basic computer graphics techniques, such as building and rendering 3D models; interactively viewing objects from different perspective points; and using shading, lighting, and texturing effects for greater realism. In addition, this book provides in-depth coverage of advanced techniques, including texture mapping, antialiasing, fog and atmospheric effects, NURBS, image processing, and more. The text also explores other key topics such as enhancing performance, OpenGL extensions, and cross-platform techniques. This seventh edition has been updated to include the newest features of OpenGL Versions 3.0 and 3.1, including Using framebuffer objects for off-screen rendering and texture updates Examples of the various new buffer object types, including uniform-buffer objects, transform feedback buffers, and vertex array objects Using texture arrays to increase performance when using numerous textures Efficient rendering using primitive restart and conditional rendering Discussion of OpenGLs deprecation mechanism and how to verify your programs for future versions of OpenGL This edition continues the discussion of the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and explains the mechanics of using this language to create complex graphics effects and boost the computational power of OpenGL. The OpenGL Technical Library provides tutorial and reference books for OpenGL. The Library enables programmers to gain a practical understanding of OpenGL and shows them how to unlock its full potential. Originally developed by SGI, the Library continues to evolve under the auspices of the Khronos OpenGL ARB Working Group, an industry consortium responsible for guiding the evolution of OpenGL and related technologies.},

For the first time, a real hidden portrait on an easel painting has been imaged by THz-TDI, with an unexpected richness of detail. THz C- and B-scans have been compared with images obtained by x-ray radiography and invasive cross-sectional imaging, leading to a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of this technique for art diagnostic purposes and defining its role among complementary tools for the investigation of art objects. We present a fast and effective method to separate single THz pulse reflections of interest from the entire signal across the image, adapted for uneven surfaces typically encountered in practical applications of the technique. Interfaces between layers of the painting have been successfully imaged, contributing substantially to the understanding of the structure of the painting.},

A typical measurement compares two electromagnetic pulses, one of which has interacted with a material and another which has not. The pulses are measured as a function of time, but the electromagnetic properties of matter are most naturally described as a function of frequency, so statistical signal processing techniques must be used to relate the time-domain measurements to the frequency-domain properties of interest. The THzTools package provides an interface for implementing maximumlikelihood methods for THz-TDS analysis, described previously (Mohtashemi et al., 2021).},

This tutorial is intended for a reader completely new to the field of THz-TDS and presents a basic understanding of THz-TDS. Hundreds of articles and many books can be consulted after reading this tutorial. We explore the basic concepts of TDS and discuss the relationship between temporal and frequency domain information. We illustrate how THz radiation can be generated and detected, and we discuss common noise sources and limitations for THz-TDS. This tutorial concludes by discussing some common experimental scenarios and explains how THz-TDS measurements can be used to identify materials, determine complex refractive indices (phase delay and absorption), and extract conductivity.},

	abstract = {We report on a method to ﬁt time-trace data from a terahertz time-domain-spectroscopy system enabling the extraction of physical parameters from a material or metamaterial. To accomplish this, we developed a Python-based open-source software called Fit@TDS that functions on a personal computer. This software includes commonly used methods where the refractive index is extracted from frequency-domain data. This method has limitations when the signal is too noisy or when an absorption peak saturates the spectrum. Thus, the software also includes a new method where the refractive indices are directly ﬁtted from the time trace. The idea is to model a material or a metamaterial through parametric physical models (Drude–Lorentz model and time-domain coupled mode theory) and implement this in the propagation model to simulate the time trace. Then, an optimization algorithm is used to retrieve the parameters of the model corresponding to the studied material/metamaterial. In this paper, we explain the method and test it on ﬁctitious samples to probe its feasibility and reliability. Finally, we used Fit@TDS on real samples of high-resistivity silicon, lactose, and gold metasurface on quartz to show the capacity of the method.},
